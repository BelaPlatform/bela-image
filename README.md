# bela-image
Images to flash on your BeagleBone Black for use with the Bela cape.

No source code at the moment, only zipped versions of the SD card image available for download. Check the Releases section

## Getting started

Download the most recent stable Bela disk image from the [releases page](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/bela-image/releases).

Image files are *xz* compressed and, once uncompressed, are ready to be flashed onto an SD card.
For instructions on how to do so, check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/Manage-your-SD-card#flashing-the-bela-image)
An SD card of at least 4GB is required.
