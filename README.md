# bela-image
Disk images to flash on your BeagleBone Black for use with the Bela cape.

## Getting started

Download the most recent stable Bela disk image from the [releases page](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/bela-image/releases).

Image files are *xz* compressed and, once uncompressed, are ready to be flashed onto an SD card.
For instructions on how to do so, check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/Manage-your-SD-card#flashing-the-bela-image).
An SD card of at least 4GB is required.
